# admin-dashboard

This project was designed to fulfill [this assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) from The Odin Project.

This is probably the most complicated front-end design I've done so far as a growing coder, but it was also extremely satisfying to work through. While my code is still primitive and I'm still early on the path of learning how to write careful, sophisticated CSS, I was surprised by how easy it was to _more or less_ get the page to look the way I wanted very quickly.

I remember looking ahead at this assignment and being pretty daunted by it. I'm very pleased to reach this milestone, prove to myself I can do it, and look ahead to the next set of challenges on my journey.
